Extractive Question Answering:
The goal for this assignment is to develop a model which takes text paragraph and question as inputs and returns the answer which is in the paragraph.

Dataset:
The dataset that is used for this project is the Spoken Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). You can download the datasets from the Dataset folder.

Model:
I used the distilbert-base-uncased model from Hugging Face which is smaller and faster version of BERT.

Testing:
F1 and Word Error Rate (WER) scores are used to assess model's performance on a test dataset. To test the model, please either train the model by running the respective scripts or please download the contents of the respective pretrained models from the below links and evaluate by giving your path to the train and test datasets in the code.
